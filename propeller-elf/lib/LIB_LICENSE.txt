The string library is mostly from Henry Spencer's string library,
posted to Usenet and placed by him in the public domain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The scanf functions and some of the string functions are from the
libnix library for the Amiga, written by Matthias Fleischer
and Gunther Nikl and placed in the public domain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The printf functions were based on code with the following copyright:
/*
 * Copyright (c) 1995 Patrick Powell.
 *
 * This code is based on code written by Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com>.
 * It may be used for any purpose as long as this notice remains intact on all
 * source code distributions.
 */

/*
 * Copyright (c) 2008 Holger Weiss.
 *
 * This version of the code is maintained by Holger Weiss <holger@jhweiss.de>.
 * My changes to the code may freely be used, modified and/or redistributed for
 * any purpose.  It would be nice if additions and fixes to this file (including
 * trivial code cleanups) would be sent back in order to let me include them in
 * the version available at <http://www.jhweiss.de/software/snprintf.html>.
 * However, this is not a requirement for using or redistributing (possibly
 * modified) versions of this file, nor is leaving this notice intact mandatory.

A few stdio and miscellaneous functions are from the dLibs library by
Dale Schumacher, which is in the public domain and comes with the
following notice:
  I'd like to see these routines distributed as widely as possible as I
feel they will be a benefit to many people.  The only restriction I'd
like to place on the use of dLibs is this.  If you modify the source
code, please don't redistribute it under the name "dLibs".  I encourage
people to look at, play with, modify and improve the source code as
much as they want, and would gladly accept suggestions (preferrably
with source code) for changes/additions to dLibs.  I simply want to
avoid the problem of digressive versions of dLibs.

Some other functions are from the MiNT library, a derivative of
dLibs by Eric Smith and others, and also in the public domain.
